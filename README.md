# EDA
As the name implies, this is code used for EDA.  It is organized into flows and snippets based on my desire to make them searchable.  
Common process is in a small number of larger files.
Less frequently used though useful code is in a separate file so I can find them more easily.
I have acquired knowledge through many books, Kaggle and of course stack overflow and the like.
